# Tu48-EffortLoggerV2
The EffortLoggerNonMainline folder contains iterations of the code as our group has continued to improve upon it. It is a purely developmental folder that shows the work progress of our group.
The FinalCodeForIntegration folder contains the latest commits made by each team member to be used in creating the final EffortLoggerV2 prototype.
The Tu48EffortLoggerV2FinalPrototype zip file contains the actual final prototype with source code and all other files needed to import a project into Eclipse and run it.
There is also TasksEclipse branch in addition to the main branch. This branch was a work in progress branch that contains much of our early development work for the program. It can be ignored for the final submission.
